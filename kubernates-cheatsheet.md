# Kubernates Commands

- Kubernates is a platform where you can run multiple instance of docker images or containers

- Kubernetes is a tool for managing containerized applications across clusters. It provides basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of application containers across clusters

- Kubernetes runs on top of Docker Engine. It uses it as its underlying infrastructure layer.

## Kubernates Cluster

    A collection of nodes + a master to manage them

## Node

    A virtual Machine that will run our containers

## Pod

    - More or less a running a container
    - Technically, a pod can run multiple container

## Deployment

    Monitors a set of pods, make sure they are running and restarts them if they crash

## Service

    Provides an easy-to-remember URL to access a running container

### Docker Image

- Single file with all the deps and config required to run a program

### Docker Container

- Instance of an program or an image

## Kubernates Steps

### Create a POD

```yaml
# K8s is extensible - we can add in out own custom objects. This specifies the set of objects we want K8s to look at
apiVersion: v1

# The type of object we want to create
kind: Pod

#  Config Options for the object we are about to create
metadata:
  name: posts # When a Pod is created, give it a name of "posts"

# The exact attributes we want to apply to the object we are about to create
spec:
  # We can create many containers in a single Pod
  containers:
    - name: posts # Make a container with a name of "posts"
      image: debirapid/posts:0.0.1 # The exact image we want to use
```

### (Recommended)Create a Deployment and then Create Pods

## Networking with Services

- To be able to access the pod from outside or make inter pod communication(microservices) we need to create services.
- There are several kinds of services.

### Cluster IP (default)

    Sets up an easy to remember URL to access a pod, Only exposes pods in the cluster.

### Node Port

    Makes a pod accessible from outside the cluster. Usually only used for dev purposes.

### Load Balancer

    Makes a pod accessible from outside the cluster. This is the right way to expose a pod to the outside world.

### External Name

    Redirects an in-cluster request to a CNAME url.

# Load Balancer

- A load balancer is responsible for distributing incoming traffic across multiple backend servers or instances.

- Load balancers can be created using cloud providers or by installing software such as nginx ingress controller on your own servers.
